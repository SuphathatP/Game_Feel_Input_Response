Acceleration Method
  
Immediate Acceleration – Provides full and responsive control of the player character but movement feels weightless and lacks physicality.
Linear Acceleration – Feels slippery and makes precise control difficult. However, it could be useful for special surfaces such as ice or wet, slippery terrain.
Ease Acceleration – Gives the character a sense of weight and momentum. Very satisfying to control and feels the most natural.
